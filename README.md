# Packing Boxes

## About

This mod allows you to pack up any block in the game into a box, take the box and place it somewhere else and unpack it again.

In other words, you can move any block in the game to another place. Not that useful for most blocks, but there are

## How does it work?

* craft some packing tape
* use packing tape on block
* this magically turns the block into a packing box
* take box with you
* place box somewhere else
* shift-use to unpack block

That's it!
